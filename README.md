# scGRN

A R package designed for users to get their gene regulatory network via Elastic net. 

## Introduction
Hi-C data is often used to analyze genome-wide chromatin organization like topologically associating domains, linearly contiguous regions of the genome that are associated in 3-D space. Thus we implement this pipeline which makes use of the hic data and user-provided enhancer list to discover latent gene regulatory network. The framework is depicted in the below figure.

## Install scGRN R package
The devtools package provides install_github() that enables people to install packages from GitHub. You can use the following code to download the scGRN package.
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("daifengwanglab/tools/scGRN")
```

After the installation, you can directly use **library(scGRN)** to load the package.
